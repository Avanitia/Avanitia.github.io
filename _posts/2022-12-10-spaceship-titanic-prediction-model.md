## Spaceship Titanic Predictive Modelling with Machine Learning

<h2>Case</h2>
<p align="justify">
This cased is based on one of Kaggle prediction competition case study. In this cosmic mystery case, transmission is received from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good. </p>

<p align="justify">
The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

 <p align="justify">
While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, the challenge is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p align="justify">
In order to solve this case, I used a predictive model to classify which passengers are transported and which one're not. Since the dependent variable is binary, non parametric model is used for the modelling.
 
<p align="justify">
Here, I used 3 algorithms for comparative study based on past study on its success rate in predicting variable. I used Support Vector Machine (SVM). Random Forest, and XGBoost. Using hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to further improve the model's prediction power, I've managed to create a model that has 0.78629 public score in Kaggle.

Keep in mind that there are improvements that can be made from this answer, example being:
<ol type = 3>
  <li>For loop in each hyperparameter range, resulting in better tuning</li>
  <li>Use other machine learning algorithm</li>
  <li>Analyze the effect of cabin and passenger name</li>
</ol>
